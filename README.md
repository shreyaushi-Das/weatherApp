🌦 Weather App

A simple and responsive Weather App built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeather API and displays:

🌡 Temperature

💨 Wind Speed

💧 Humidity

🌄 Dynamic background/icons based on weather conditions

This project was part of my JavaScript learning journey and helped me understand API integration, DOM manipulation, and async programming.
